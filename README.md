My responsive portfolio website: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (mobile menu). 

Summary:

Asside from showing examples of my work, the most useful part about this project for others to look at would be the custom mobile menu, which I made with minimal vanilla JavaScript and CSS transitions. I also used CSS transitions to get the drop shadow on hover effect for nav buttons and images, as well as changing the background color of the highlighter link styles.
